# Brainf-k-Interpreter
A simple Brainf**k interpreter written in python with "video memory"

Add a # to your Brainf**k code to make it display the "video memory"

to execute a file use: python interpreter.py yourfile
else it will only execute the default code

if you are just here to look at the project there are a few bf files which you can try out in the interpreter

if it doesnt run pls check if all of the libraries are installed correctly if not use:

pip install pygame

pip install sys #even tho i think its included by default

pip install time #even tho i think its included by default

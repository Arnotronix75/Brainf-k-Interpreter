# Brainf-k-Interpreter
A simple Brainf**k interpreter written in python with "video memory"

Add a # to your Brainf**k code to make it display the "video memory"

to execute a file use: python interpreter.py yourfile
else it will only execute the default code

if you are just here to look at the project there are a few bf files which you can try out in the interpreter

if it doesnt run pls check if all of the libraries are installed correctly if not use:

pip install pygame

pip install sys #even tho i think its included by default

pip install time #even tho i think its included by default

i dont think i have to tell you that you need to have a python interpreter installed. you can install it from the official python website (python.org) but pls check the install pip box in the installer (if you are still on windows)

on linux (even tho i think it comes preinstalled) you can use:

sudo apt-get install python

for arch:

sudo pacman -S python
